# Output file formats

Although most output files include headers that describe the data, a brief explanation of the output files is provided below.

## Read to isoform assignment

Tab-separated values, the columns are:

* `read_id` - read id;
* `chr` - chromosome id;
* `strand` - strand of the assigned isoform (not to be confused with read mapping strand);
* `isoform_id` - isoform id to which the read was assigned;
* `gene_id` - gene id to which the read was assigned;
* `assignment_type` - assignment type, can be:
    - `unique` - reads was unambiguously assigned to a single known isoform;
    - `unique_minor_difference` - read was assigned uniquely but has alignment artifacts;
    - `inconsistent` - read was matched with inconsistencies, closest match(es) are reported;
    - `ambiguous` - read was assigned to multiple isoforms equally well;
    - `noninfomative` - reads is intronic/intergenic.
* `assignment_events` - list of detected inconsistencies; for each assigned isoform a list of detected inconsistencies relative to the respective isoform is stored; values in each list are separated by `+` symbol, lists are separated by comma, the number of lists equals to the number of assigned isoforms; possible events are (see graphical representation below):
    - consistent events:
        - `none` / `.` / `undefined` - no special event detected;
        - `mono_exon_match` mono-exonic read matched to mono-exonic transcript;
        - `fsm` - full splice match;
        - `ism_5/3` - incomplete splice match, truncated on 5'/3' side;
        - `ism_internal` - incomplete splice match, truncated on both sides;
        - `mono_exonic` - mono-exonic read matching spliced isoform;
        - `tss_match` / `tss_match_precise` - 5' read is located less than 50 / `delta` bases from the TSS of the assigned isoform
        - `tes_match` / `tes_match_precise` - 3' read is located less than 50 / `delta` bases from the TES of the assigned isoform (can be reported without detecting polyA sites)
    - alignment artifacts:
        - `intron_shift` - intron that seems to be shifted due to misalignment (typical for Nanopores);
        - `exon_misalignment` - short exon that seems to be missed due to misalignment  (typical for Nanopores);
        - `fake_terminal_exon_5/3` - short terminal exon at 5'/3' end that looks like an alignment artifact (typical for Nanopores);  
        - `terminal_exon_misalignment_5/3` - missed reference short terminal exon;
        - `exon_elongation_5/3` - minor exon extension at 5'/3' end (not exceeding 30bp);
        - `fake_micro_intron_retention` - short annotated introns are often missed by the aligners and thus are not considered as intron retention;
    - intron retentions:
        - `intron_retention` - intron retention;
        - `unspliced_intron_retention`  - intron retention by mono-exonic read;
        - `incomplete_intron_retention_5/3` - terminal exon at 5'/3' end partially covers adjacent intron;
    - significant inconsistencies (each type end with `_known` if _all_ resulting read introns are annotated and `_novel` otherwise):
        - `major_exon_elongation_5/3` - significant exon extension at 5'/3' end (exceeding 30bp);
        - `extra_intron_5/3` - additional intron on the 5'/3' end of the isoform;
        - `extra_intron` - read contains additional intron in the middle of exon;
        - `alt_donor_site` - read contains alternative donor site;
        - `alt_acceptor_site` - read contains alternative annotated acceptor site;
        - `intron_migration` - read contains alternative annotated intron of approximately the same length as in the isoform;
        - `intron_alternation` - read contains alternative intron, which doesn't fall intro any of the categories above;
        - `mutually_exclusive_exons` - read contains different exon(s) of the same total length comparing to the isoform;
        - `exon_skipping` - read skips exon(s) comparing to the isoform;
        - `exon_merge` - read skips exon(s) comparing to the isoform, but a sequence of a similar length is attached to a neighboring exon;
        - `exon_gain` - read contains additional exon(s) comparing to the isoform;
        - `exon_detach` - read contains additional exon(s) comparing to the isoform, but a neighboring exon looses a sequnce of a similar length;
        - `terminal_exon_shift` - read has alternative terminal exon;   
        - `alternative_structure` - reads has different intron chain that does not fall into any of categories above;
    - alternative transcription start / end (reported when poly-A tails are present):
        - `alternative_polya_site` - read has alternative polyadenylation site;
        - `internal_polya_site` - poly-A tail detected but seems to be originated from A-rich intronic region;
        - `correct_polya_site` - poly-A site matches reference transcript end;
        - `aligned_polya_tail` - poly-A tail aligns to the reference;  
        - `alternative_tss` - alternative transcription start site.
* `exons` - list of coordinates for normalized read exons (1-based, indels and polyA exons are excluded);
* `additional` - field for supplementary information, which may include:
    - `PolyA` - True if poly-A tail is detected;
    - `Canonical` - True if all read introns are canonical, Unspliced is used for mono-exon reads; (use `--check_canonical`)

Note, that a single read may occur more than once if assigned ambiguously.

## Expression table format

Tab-separated values, the columns are:

* `feature_id` - genomic feature ID;
* `TPM` or `count` - expression value (float).

For grouped counts, each column contains expression values of a respective group.

## Exon and intron count format

Tab-separated values, the columns are:

* `chr` - chromosome ID;
* `start` - feature leftmost 1-based positions;
* `end` - feature rightmost 1-based positions;
* `strand` - feature strand;
* `flags` - symbolic feature flags, can contain the following characters:
    - `X` - terminal feature;
    - `I` - internal feature;
    - `T` - feature appears as both terminal and internal in different isoforms;
    - `S` - feature has similar positions to some other feature;
    - `C` - feature is contained in another feature;
    - `U` - unique feature, appears only in a single known isoform;
    - `M` - feature appears in multiple different genes.
* `gene_ids` - list if gene ids feature belong to;
* `group_id` - read group if provided (NA by default);
* `include_counts` - number of reads that include this feature;
* `exclude_counts` - number of reads that span, but do not include this feature;

## Transcript models format

Constructed transcript models are stored in usual [GTF format](https://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html).
Contains `exon`, `transcript` and `gene` features.
Transcript ids have the following format: `transcript_###.TYPE`,
where `###` is the unique number (not necessarily consecutive) and TYPE can be one of the following:

* known - previously annotated transcripts;
* nic - novel in catalog, new transcript that contains only annotated introns;
* nnic - novel not in catalog, new transcript that contains unannotated introns.

The `attribute` field also contains `gene_id` (either matches reference gene id or can be `novel_gene_###`), `reference_gene_id` (same value) and `reference_transcript_id` (either original isoform id or `novel`).
In addition, it contains `canonical` property if `--check_canonical` is set.
